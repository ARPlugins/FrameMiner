The plugin it's almost done, it will automatically disable it self because it is missing a permission on the code, than it can't be used at the moment. Sorry.
I'll fix this as soon as possible. 

FrameMiner is a [**BSkyBlock**](https://github.icom/BentoBoxWorld/BSkyBlock) addon.

This addon enable players to mine End Portal Frames.

[soon I'll make a better description]
