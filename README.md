The addon enable players to mine End Portal Frame on BSkyBlock.

## Getting the pickaxe

First of all, to mine the frame **ONLY** works with diamond pickaxe.

The Unbreaking works.

To get the pickaxe at the moment do this command:

`</give @s diamond_pickaxe{display:{Lore:["\u00a77Brutal I"]}}>`,

if this don't work due a plugin than do `</minecraft:give @s diamond_pickaxe{display:{Lore:["\u00a77Brutal I"]}}>`, 

if it fails to than run on console this one `</give (your_nick) diamond_pickaxe{display:{Lore:["ยง7Brutal I"]}}>`
